My name is Lewis Draper. I am a 24 year old game developer, currently working as an Associate Programmer at d3t Ltd in the UK. I started this blog as a way of showcasing some of my personal development, but I hope it can also help other game developers if they come across the same issues I do as I work.

I primarily work with Unreal Engine, so most of the posts will be concerned with me getting to grips with it and trying to make some cool stuff.
